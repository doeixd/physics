2025-12-09 - 15-30 - Major Integrations and Alignment with Preferences

Integrated AI suggestions for strengthening the paper:
- Added rigorous no-signaling proof with theorem and mathematical derivation.
- Enhanced threshold derivation with physical arguments from fluctuation-dissipation, redundancy (Quantum Darwinism), and Landauer principle.
- Shifted primary experimental prediction to mesoscopic apparatus (trapped ions) for feasible 2% deviations from Born rule.
- Improved philosophical positioning with clear taxonomy table distinguishing from alternatives.
- Added theorems for master equation well-posedness and fixed point structure.
- Replaced open questions section with honest "Limitations and Open Questions" acknowledging gaps.
- Expanded notation table to comprehensive reference.

Aligned with CLAUDE.md preferences:
- Removed unnecessary boldface in tables and text.
- Fixed Unicode characters (ψ → \psi, ✓ → \checkmark, × → x).
- Ensured citations in \cite{} format.
